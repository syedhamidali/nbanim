# NBAnim

NBAnim is a Python utility designed to display image sequences as animations within a Jupyter Notebook. It provides a simple interface to control the playback of image sequences, including play, pause, stop, and adjust the animation speed, making it ideal for visual demonstrations and presentations.

## Features

- Play, pause, and stop animations.
- Navigate through image frames with next and previous controls.
- Adjust animation speed dynamically.
- Easy integration with Jupyter Notebooks.

## Installation

NBAnim can be installed using pip, by cloning the repository, or directly from GitHub. Below are instructions for each method:

### Using pip

To install NBAnim directly using pip, execute the following command in your terminal:

```zsh
pip install nbanim
```

### Cloning the Repository

If you prefer to install NBAnim by cloning the repository, first ensure you have git installed on your system. Then, run the following command:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/syedhamidali/nbanim.git
cd nbanim
pip install .
```

This will clone the repository to your local machine and install it using pip.

### Directly from GitHub

You can also install the latest version of NBAnim directly from GitHub using pip:

```zsh
pip install git+https://github.com/syedhamidali/nbanim.git
```

This method is useful if you want to install the very latest version that may include changes not yet published to PyPI.

## Requirements

NBAnim requires the following to run:

- Python 3.6+
- IPython
- ipywidgets

Please make sure you have these requirements installed before installing NBAnim.

## Example Usage 1
Here is a simple example of how to use NBAnim to display an animation in a Jupyter Notebook:

```python
from nbanim import NBAnim

# List of image file paths for the frames of your animation
frames = ['path/to/frame1.png', 'path/to/frame2.png', 'path/to/frame3.png']

# Create an instance of NBAnim with the frames and optionally set the animation speed
anim = NBAnim(frames, animation_speed=0.5)
```

## Example Usage 2

```python
import glob
from nbanim import NBAnim

# List of image file paths for the frames of your animation
frames = sorted(glob.glob("~/Downloads/*png"))

# Create an instance of NBAnim with the frames and optionally set the animation speed
anim = NBAnim(frames, animation_speed=0.5)
```

### The animation controls will be displayed automatically in the Jupyter Notebook
In this example, replace 'path/to/frame1.png', 'path/to/frame2.png', and 'path/to/frame3.png' with the actual paths to your image files. The NBAnim class takes care of displaying the images and providing a user interface for controlling the animation directly within the notebook.
