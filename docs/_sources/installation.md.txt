## Installation

NBAnim can be installed using pip, by cloning the repository, or directly from GitHub. Below are instructions for each method:

### Using pip

To install NBAnim directly using pip, execute the following command in your terminal:

```zsh
pip install nbanim
```

### Cloning the Repository

If you prefer to install NBAnim by cloning the repository, first ensure you have git installed on your system. Then, run the following command:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/syedhamidali/nbanim.git
cd nbanim
pip install .
```

This will clone the repository to your local machine and install it using pip.

### Directly from GitHub

You can also install the latest version of NBAnim directly from GitHub using pip:

```zsh
pip install git+https://github.com/syedhamidali/nbanim.git
```

This method is useful if you want to install the very latest version that may include changes not yet published to PyPI.
